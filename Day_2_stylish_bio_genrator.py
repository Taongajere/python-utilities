Challenge: Stylish Bio Generator for Instagram/Twitter

Create a Python utility that asks the user for a few key details and generates a short, stylish bio that could be used for social media profiles like Instagram or Twitter.

Your program should:
1. Prompt the user to enter their:
   - Name
   - Profession
   - One-liner passion or goal
   - Favorite emoji (optional)
   - Website or handle (optional)

2. Generate a stylish 2-3 line bio using the inputs. It should feel modern, concise, and catchy.

3. Add optional hashtags or emojis for flair.

Example:
Input:
  Name: Riya
  Profession: Designer
  Passion: Making things beautiful
  Emoji: ðŸŽ¨
  Website: @riya.design

Output:
  ðŸŽ¨ Riya | Designer  
  ðŸ’¡ Making things beautiful  
  ðŸ”— @riya.design

Bonus:
- Let the user pick from 2-3 different layout styles.
- Ask the user if they want to save the result into a `.txt` file.
